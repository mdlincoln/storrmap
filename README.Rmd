# storrmap

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mdlincoln/storrmap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mdlincoln/storrmap)

The goal of storrmap is to iterate over R objects that are too large to fit in memory with an interface between purrr's `map` function and storr's persistent key/value stores.

## Installation

You can install storrmap from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mdlincoln/storrmap")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
